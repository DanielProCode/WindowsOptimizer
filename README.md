**N3XUS** is a powerful and lightweight Windows PC optimization tool that brings together a ton of features to make your system run faster, cleaner, and smoother. It's packed with everything you need to enhance performance and eliminate unnecessary clutter without diving deep into your system settings manually.

## ðŸ”’ Why Compiled?

Itâ€™s compiled because I donâ€™t want to mess up your system, and frankly, I want to keep everything private until itâ€™s completely stable. This is a tool that manipulates your system, and I want to make sure it works perfectly before I start letting people dig into the source code. **N3XUS** is still in its early stages, and Iâ€™m focused on ironing out bugs and improving stability. Once itâ€™s solid, Iâ€™ll consider open-sourcing it.

## ðŸ›  Installation

**N3XUS** comes in a compiled `.exe` format for simplicity. Here's how you can install it:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/daniel/n3xus/releases).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Launch **N3XUS** and let it do its magic!

## ðŸ§° Planned Features (Coming Soon)

## ðŸ›¡ Privacy and Security

Your privacy is important to me. **N3XUS** never collects personal data or sends any information back to servers. It only works locally on your system and cleans things up with your consent. Period. Everything stays on your machine.
